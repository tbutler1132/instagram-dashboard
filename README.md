Unfortunately while you can create test user Facebook profiles, there is no immediately obvious way to connect that profile to a business instagram account. Attempts to do so were needlessly frustrating for the simplicity of the application so I created real pages and connected them to my own Facebook profile. A recorded demonstration of the application can be viewed at the link above. If the app is developed further a more sensible testing solution will be implemented.

Implements Facebook login using Graph API. Pulls in posts from feed of an Instagram account linked to user's Facebook profile.

Unfortunately while you can create test user Facebook profiles, there is no immediately obvious way to connect that profile to a business instagram account. Attempts to do so were needlessly frustrating for the simplicity of the application so I created real pages and connected them to my own Facebook profile. A recorded demonstration of the application can be viewed at the link above. If the app is developed further a more sensible testing solution will be implemented.
